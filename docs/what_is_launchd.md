* This is the most recent link I can find.`launchd` documentation seems oddly thin on
the ground. I gathered the best of what I've found in [What is launchd]().

* [Launchd man page (opens the terminal)](x-man-page://launchd.plist) - or just run
`man launchd` in your terminal.
* [Launchd.info](https://launchd.info/) - an extensive third-party resource
* [Reddit - cron or launchd](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/13r469w/cron_or_launchd/)

These Apple developer docs are seemingly archived, however they are still linked to via
the `launchd` man page.

* [Apple - "The preferred way to add a timed job is to use launchd"]([text](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-CH1-SW2))
